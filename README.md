# Customer_Churn_NN
Churn is the description of the customer who transfers from one provider of telephone services to 
another. Customer Churn can be caused by a variety of factors, including high prices, poor 
customer service, product quality issues, or a better alternative appearing on the market. Churn can 
also be influenced by factors outside of a company's control, such as changes in economic conditions 
or shifts in consumer preferences. Customer churn prediction is an essential task for any company 
that provides subscription-based services or products. It involves predicting which customers are 
likely to stop using a companyâ€™s services or products and taking proactive measures to retain those 
customers before they defect to a competitor. This can include offering incentives, personalized 
communication, and improving the overall customer experience. In this project Sequencial Neural network is used.
